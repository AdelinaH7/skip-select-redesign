Hello, REMWaste people!

This is my assigment for the code challenge and I hope you like my approach. For this I changed the information within the card section and include all the informations below the picture in order to have more clear vision about yards.

I believe the blue yard chip situated in the right upper corner of each yard skip image was uneccesary and I removed it because this information is also included in the title.

Also, regarding "Not Allowed On The Road" yellow chip situated ass well in the image area was moved above the "Select this Skip" button.

The price was moved in the right part of the card in order to be more visible to the user and to have all the important information in the left side.

Regarding the colors and the rest of the actual card design I did not make any chaganges because I wanted to keep the website harmony as it is for rest of the pages.

Thanks you for your time and I'm waiting for your response!
